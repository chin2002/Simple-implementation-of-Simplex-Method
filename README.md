# Simple-implementation-of-Simplex-Method
This is a barebones, simplistic implementation of the simplex method used in linear optimization using only the numpy library.

The file Simplex_method_exp.ipynb contains the function Simplex_method() which takes an initial simplex tableau and outputs the result as a log of the iterated row operations,
along with the entering and leaving variables and the updated basis for each iteration.
